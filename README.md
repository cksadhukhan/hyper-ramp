# P2P Onramp and Offramp

This repository provides a starter kit for building a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) onramp and offramp platform. It includes a clean code structure and an easy-to-navigate architecture, making it simple for developers to plug in their business logic and start working without worrying about the client UI.

## Features

- **Clean Code Structure:** The project is organized with a clean and modular code structure, making it easy to understand and maintain.

- **Inbuilt Mini Design System:** This repository comes with an inbuilt mini design system, including primitive components, that you can leverage to build your user interface quickly.

- **TypeSafe with TypeScript:** The project is set up with TypeScript, ensuring type safety and improved development workflows.

## Tech Stack

- **React Native:** The project is built using React Native, allowing you to develop for both iOS and Android platforms with a single codebase.

- **Styled-Components:** Styling is done with Styled-Components, enabling you to create styled and responsive components with ease.

- **TypeScript:** Type safety and improved code quality are achieved through TypeScript, making development more robust and efficient.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the P2P Onramp and Offramp project:

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd p2p-onramp-offramp
   npm install
   ```

3. Start developing your business logic and connect it to the provided components and design system.

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
